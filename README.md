# Car Fleet Management System

This project implements a comprehensive Car Fleet Management System, designed to monitor vehicle telemetry, manage vehicle data, and generate alerts for critical events. The system is built with a modular and scalable architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers for improved maintainability and extensibility.

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a layered architecture, with clear separation of responsibilities:

-   **`main.py`**: The entry point of the application, responsible for initializing the application and integrating various components.
-   **`models/`**: Defines the data structures (schemas) for core entities like `Vehicle`, `Telemetry`, and `Alert`. These models represent the data stored and processed by the system.
-   **`routes/`**: Handles API endpoints and routes incoming requests to the appropriate service layer functions. It defines the interface for interacting with the system.
-   **`services/`**: Contains the business logic for managing vehicles, processing telemetry data, and handling alerts. This layer orchestrates interactions with the storage layer and applies business rules.
-   **`storage/`**: Manages database interactions and data persistence. The `database.py` module handles connections and data operations.
-   **`utils/`**: Provides utility functions and helper modules, such as `alert_generator.py` for creating alerts based on specific conditions.




## Architectural Approach: Layered Architecture with Separation of Concerns

This system employs a **layered architectural approach**, specifically a variation of the **Model-Service-Route pattern (or Controller-Service-Repository if considering the storage layer as a repository)**. This approach emphasizes the separation of concerns, ensuring each component has a distinct responsibility:

1.  **Models**: Define the data structures and represent the domain entities, acting as the "data layer."
2.  **Services**: Encapsulate the business logic and coordinate operations, acting as the "business logic layer." They interact with the `storage` layer to persist and retrieve data.
3.  **Routes (Controllers)**: Handle incoming requests, validate input, and delegate tasks to the appropriate services, acting as the "presentation/API layer."
4.  **Storage**: Manages database interactions, abstracting the underlying data persistence mechanism.
5.  **Utilities**: Provide supporting functionalities that are not part of the core business logic but are essential for the system's operation.

This design promotes **modularity**, **testability**, and **scalability** by allowing independent development and modification of different layers without significantly impacting others. It also improves code organization and readability, making the system easier to understand and maintain.
